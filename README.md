Navigate through rooms using the arrow keys. Much of this game involves clicking on items in a room or your inventory. Once clicked, an item will present you with different actions it can perform. If you click the "Use" action, click on another item to see if there is a reaction. 

In the foyer and landing, you need to climb the stairs to get to the second and third stories. That is done by clicking the "climb" button after clicking on the stairs in the room. Once upstairs, press the back button in the landing or Smith's Entertance to go back down a floor.
